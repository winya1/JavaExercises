n this exercise, we create the classes Item, Suitcase and Hold to practise the use of objects containing other objects.

Item-class
Create an Item class from which objects can be instantiated to represent different items. The information to store is the name and weight of the item (kg).

Add the following methods to the class:

Constructor that takes the name and the weight of the item as parameters
Method public String getName(), which returns the item's name
Method public int getWeight(), which returns the item's weight
Method public String toString(), which returns the string "name (weight kg)"
